## 🌟 Introduction

Predicting car prices can be challenging due to the numerous factors that influence the value of a car. This project aims to provide an accurate prediction of car prices using machine learning models trained on a dataset with multiple features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various features including:

- **fueltype**: Fuel type of the car.
- **aspiration**: Aspiration type.
- **doornumber**: Number of doors.
- **carbody**: Body style of the car.
- **drivewheel**: Type of drive wheel.
- **enginelocation**: Location of the engine.
- **wheelbase**: Wheelbase of the car.
- **carlength**: Length of the car.
- **carwidth**: Width of the car.
- **carheight**: Height of the car.
- **curbweight**: Curb weight of the car.
- **enginetype**: Type of engine.
- **cylindernumber**: Number of cylinders.
- **enginesize**: Size of the engine.
- **fuelsystem**: Fuel system used in the car.
- **boreratio**: Bore ratio of the engine.
- **stroke**: Stroke of the engine.
- **compressionratio**: Compression ratio of the engine.
- **horsepower**: Horsepower of the engine.
- **peakrpm**: Peak RPM of the engine.
- **citympg**: City miles per gallon.
- **highwaympg**: Highway miles per gallon.
- **price**: Price of the car (target variable).
